            <p>Dearest Monse,</p>
            <p>For the longest time, love has always been an incomprehensible and foreign concept to me. I've always 
                struggled with the idea of love and understanding what it means to love and be in love with someone. I've always
                wondered how people know when they're in love and how they differentiate it from simple attraction. While I've yet
                to find the the answer to many of these questions, I've come to learn that love doesn't have to be as complicated 
                as I've made it out to be. 
            </p>
            <p>In fact, love can be as simple as wanting to be by your side. Love is wanting you to eat well and </p>
            <p>It's been a pleasure being with you for the past year. I can't say it hasn't been quite the journey
                already, but I'm glad we've been able to stuck it out together thus far. I'll be the first to admit that I'm 
                not the best lover. And I'm far from being the best girlfriend. I'm quite unpredictable, stubborn, and often shut
                down when I'm upset. I won't lie, being long distance has been rough. And this past semester has been especially. 
            </p>
