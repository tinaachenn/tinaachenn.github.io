            <p>Dearest Monse,</p>
            <p>For the longest time, love has always been an incomprehensible and foreign concept to me. I've always 
                struggled with the idea of love and understanding what it means to love and be in love with someone. I've always
                wondered how people know when they're in love and how they differentiate it from simple attraction. I always wondered
                how I'll know when I'm in love. While I've yet to find the the answer to many of these questions, I've come to learn 
                that love doesn't have to be as complicated as I've made it out to be and that maybe I've already found love. 
            </p>
            <p>In fact, love, I've found, can be as simple as wanting to be by your side. Love is wanting you to eat well and bringing 
                you treats after a particularly hard day. Love is looking for you in a crowded room and feeling at ease once I've 
                spotted you. Love is happily spending the day running errands with you or picking you up after work. Love is purchasing 
                trinkets that I think you'd enjoy and finding ways to see you in everything and everywhere, despite being 3000 miles 
                apart two-thirds of every year. Love is always thinking of you and wondering if you are well, if you are happy, 
                if you are content. Love is wanting to celebrate all your achievements and battling all your worries together. Love is 
                wanting to holding you tightly when the world and those around you are so unnecessarily cruel to you and hoping you know 
                that you are always loved. No matter what. Love is wanting to shield you from stress, from pain, from sadness, and 
                everything in between. Love is wanting to be with you and only you. Love is hoping you'll need me and trying my best to 
                fulfill that need. Love is you.
            </p>
            <p> The nuances of love still confound me. I won't deny that I think love is scary. It fact, maybe one of my biggest fears is 
                being in love. To love someone means giving up my entire heart and soul. It means giving someone the power to hurt me in 
                ways I've never been hurt before. It means entrusting someone with all my fears, my worries, my insecurities, my hopes, 
                and my dreams. It means losing control of my emotions and tossing away the unwavering facade I've worked so hard to build. 
                It means letting someone see me for who I truly man. In truth, I'm terrified. Often, I'm unsure if I'm ready for it all. 
                Sometimes I would rather just mean nothing to everyone and live my life relying only on myself. I hate being vulnerable and weak. 
                I hate being dependent and I hate being readable. I want to love someone without having to give myself up. I fear serving my 
                heart on a silver platter and living with the possibility of it being smashed to pieces by the hands of another.
            </p>
